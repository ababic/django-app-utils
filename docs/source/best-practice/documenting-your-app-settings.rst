Documenting your app settings
=============================

In order for users to know what they can override (and how), you'll need to document the settings somewhere.

If you don't have one already, I would highly recommend adding a "Settings reference" page to your documentation, similar to the one in the one in the `wagtailmenus documentation
<https://wagtailmenus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings_reference.html>`_.

You should clearly explain what each setting does, what type of value is expected, and any relevant limitations that apply to the value (such as upper/lower boundaries for numbers, or maximum lengths for strings).
