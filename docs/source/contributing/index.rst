Contributing to Cogwheels
=========================


Hi! Firstly, thank you for considering to help out. I've always found contributing to open source to be a really rewarding experience, and it's important to me that the experience of contributing to Cogwheels is rewarding too.

There are plenty of things you can do to help:

- Improving the documentation
- Reporting bugs and other issues
- Submitting feature requests
- Discussing open issues
- Reviewing pull requests from other contributors
- Fixing bugs

I am also happy to accept pull requests for new features, but before submitting, please:

- Raise an issue beforehand, explaining what you are looking to achieve, and await a reply.    
- Be prepared to write unit tests and documentation to cover any new functionality.


Using the issue tracker
=======================

The `issue tracker <https://github.com/ababic/django-cogwheels/issues>`_ is the preferred channel for reporting bugs and submitting feature requests. I try to respond to important things within a few days, but there's no way I can guarantee a reply. Please be patient.
