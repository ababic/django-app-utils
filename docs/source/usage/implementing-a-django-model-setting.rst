===================================
Implementing a Django model setting
===================================

A Django model setting is a setting that allows users to swap out a default Django model for a custom one (or an alternative that including in your app).

Setting values must be defined as `model strings`, in the format "app_label.Model".

When you request the model from your app's settings helper, Cogwheels utilises Django's ``django.apps.apps.get_model()`` method to retrieve the relevant Django model, and caches the import to improve the efficiency of repeat requests for the same model.

.. NOTE ::
    When a model setting is overridden:

    - Cogwheels does not prevent the default model from being created or otherwise interfere with your migration history. 
    - So long as the relevant app remains installed, the default model will remain available, and any existing data will remain untouched in the database.
    - No data is migrated to the custom model automatically. If necessary, this will be down to you or your users to implement.
    - The replacement model must be installed in order to be imported successfully (the relevant app must be added to the user's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting).


Specifying a default value
==========================

App settings are simply variables with upper-case names, added to your app's ``conf/defaults.py`` module, and Django model settings are no exception. You just have to ensure the model strings you use as default values are correct, and follow the "app_label.Model" format. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # yourapp/conf/defaults.py

    DOCUMENT_MODEL = "myapp_documents.Document"

    IMAGE_MODEL = "myapp_images.Image"

    MAIN_MENU_MODEL = "myapp_menus.MainMenu"

Users will override these settings by adding override values to their Django settings, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    # userdjangoproject/settings/base.py

    ...

    # ---------------------------------
    # Overrides for ``your-django-app``
    # ---------------------------------

    YOURAPP_DOCUMENT_MODEL = "media.CustomDocument"

    YOURAPP_IMAGE_MODEL = "media.CustomImage"

    YOURAPP_MAIN_MENU_MODEL = "core.CustomMainMenu"


.. NOTE::
    Users define overrides using *prefixed* setting names. The prefix used in the example above is **YOURAPP_** because of where the ``conf`` app is defined in the example, but this will differ for your app. For more information see: :ref:`finding-the-namespace-prefix`.


Retrieving the app setting value
================================

You can use the settings helper's ``models`` attribute shortcut or ``get_model()`` method to retrieve model classes referenced by Django model setting values. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    > from yourapp.conf import settings

    > settings.models.MAIN_MENU_MODEL
    yourapp.models.MainMenu

    > settings.get_model("MAIN_MENU_MODEL")
    yourapp.models.MainMenu


Validation and error handling
=============================

When you use the settings helper's ``models`` attribute shortcut or ``get_model()`` method to retrieve the Django model, Cogwheels applies some basic validation to the setting value to ensure it is in the correct format, and will also raise a custom exception if the model cannot be imported.

If you define an invalid default value for the setting:

- A ``DefaultValueTypeInvalid`` error is raised if the value is not a string.
- A ``DefaultValueFormatInvalid`` error is raised if the string is not in the correct format.
- A ``DefaultValueNotImportable`` error is raised if attempting to import the model results in a ``LookupError``.

If a user uses an invalid value as an override in their Django settings:

- A ``OverrideValueTypeInvalid`` error is raised if the value is not a string.
- A ``OverrideValueFormatInvalid`` error is raised if the string is not in the correct format.
- A ``OverrideValueNotImportable`` error is raised if attempting to import the model results in a ``LookupError``.


Accessing the 'model string' value
----------------------------------

In cases where you only need the string value, instead of the model class itself, you can reference the setting as a direct attribute of the settings helper, or use the ``get()`` method:

.. code-block:: console

    > from yourapp.conf import settings

    > settings.MAIN_MENU_MODEL
    "yourapp.MainMenu"

    > settings.get("MAIN_MENU_MODEL")
    "yourapp.models.MainMenu"

However, doing so **will not invoke the built-in validation and error handling behaviour** provided by the ``models`` shortcut or ``get_model()`` method. 


Behind the scenes
=================

When you request a model setting value from ``settings`` using:

- ``settings.models.MODEL_SETTING_NAME`` or
- ``settings.get_model('MODEL_SETTING_NAME')``

Cogwheels does the following:

1.  If the requested setting is deprecated, a helpfully worded ``DeprecationWarning`` is raised to prompt users to review their implementation.
2.  Cogwheels looks for a **raw** (string) setting value that it can use to import the model:

    1.  If users of your app have defined an override value in their Django settings using the correct prefix and setting name (e.g. ``YOURAPP_MODEL_SETTING_NAME``), that value is used.
    2.  If the requested setting is a 'replacement' for a single deprecated setting, Cogwheels also looks in your user's Django settings for override values using the **deprecated** setting name (e.g. ``YOURAPP_DEPRECATED_MODEL_SETTING_NAME``), and (after raising a helpfully worded ``DeprecationWarning``) uses that if found. 
    3.  If no override value was found, the default value that you used in ``defaults.py`` is used.

3. The raw value is then checked to ensure that it is a string. If it is not, a helpfully worded ``OverrideValueTypeInvalid`` or ``DefaultValueTypeInvalid`` error is raised.
4. The string value is checked to ensure it it matches the expected format (e.g. 'app_label.Model'). If it does not, a helpfully worded ``OverrideValueFormatInvalid`` or ``DefaultValueFormatInvalid`` error is raised.
5. Cogwheels attempts to import the model using Django's ``django.apps.apps.get_model()`` method. If the import fails, a helpfully worded ``OverrideValueNotImportable`` or ``DefaultValueNotImportable`` error is raised.

The successfully imported model is cached, so that the steps 2-5 can be bypassed the next time the same setting value is requested.
